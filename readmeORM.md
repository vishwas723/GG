What is ORM?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping   it allows us to interact with relational Database using objects only (or else we would have required sql queries to interact with the database)

Some of the ORM frameworks are

* Hibernate
* toplink
* EclipseLink
* iBatis

Note : all these frameworks are built on JPA(Java Persistance API) specification....

So in case if you want to switch from one framework to other it will be easy because all will have JPA specification
