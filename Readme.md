First is class , A class can have multiple  functions

class name should be same as file name

if you are saving  some classes  in 1 folder(package) and want to use its object  in  another folder structure u just need to import that class by giving below command
* import packagename.class;  

or if you want to import whole package 
* import package.* ;
